- Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given city.
- Defines a function checkWeather that takes a city name as an argument.
- Makes an API request to fetch the weather data for the city.
- Parses the response data and updates the UI with the weather information.
- Adds an event listener to the search button to call the checkWeather function when clicked.
